/**
 * This class manages event dispatching in editor.
 * Users can either register their event receivers here or dispatch event to
 * the receivers in this manager.
 *
 * There may be several EventManagers in one editor instance. For example, each plugin
 * will have it own EventManager and the editor also has a root event manager for external
 * listeners.
 *
 * Note that the event type must be exact. That's to say, you need to use a terminal class instead
 * of using its parent classes. For instance, if you register a receiver with the event type {@link Event},
 * no event will be sent to your receiver.
